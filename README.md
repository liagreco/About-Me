# About Me

Hi, there! I wanted to give a little introduction of myself!  My name is Lia, and I am new to the world of data analytics ... well, somewhat new.  I have prior experience in the pharmaceutical industry, where I worked as a Quality Control Chemist.  I really enjoyed  analyzing large datasets, and when I discovered the opportunities in data analysis, I knew I found my passion.  It took all the fun parts of my previous role and packaged it into my dream job. Initially, I started to advance my skills in **SQL** and then, I expanded my skills to **R** and **Tableau**, through completion of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certifcate.   The main reason for this blurb is in part for viewers of my account, but mostly for myself, so that I can look back at how far I come.  I hope you enjoy my projects, and I am always open to improving myself, so feedback is greatly appreciated.  Thank you!
