# About Me 📝

My name is **Lia**, and I am **new** to the world of **data analytics** ... well, somewhat new. 

I am a **biochemistry graduate**, who has prior experience in the pharmaceutical industry as a Quality Control Chemist. I really enjoyed analyzing large datasets, and when I discovered the opportunities in **data analysis**, I knew I found my **passion**. It took all the fun parts of my previous role and packaged it into my **dream job**. 

Initially, I started to advance my skills in **SQL** and then, I expanded my skills to **R** and **Tableau**, through completion of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. The main reason for this blurb is in part for viewers of my account, but mostly for myself, so that I can look back at how far I come. 

I hope you enjoy my projects, and I am always open to improving myself, so **feedback** is greatly appreciated. Thank you!
